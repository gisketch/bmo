## 1. Setup CRT Effect

- [x] 1.1 Add CSS classes for scanlines, vignette, and flicker to `index.css` or Tailwind config.
- [x] 1.2 Create a `CRTEffect` component or add the overlay directly to `Screen.tsx`.

## 2. Integration

- [x] 2.1 Apply the CRT effect overlay to the BMO screen.
- [x] 2.2 Ensure the overlay has `pointer-events: none` so it doesn't block interactions.
- [x] 2.3 Test the visual appearance and adjust opacity/flicker speed as needed.
